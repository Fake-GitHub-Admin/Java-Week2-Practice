# Java-Week2-Practice

3/26 : So for this week I am going to replicate the Javascript Project as well as attempt to use many other java skills like classes as well.

3/27 : Taking time today to review all my Java stuff all day. Side note placed a few lines of codes, more information to come especially the replacent for that function and its parameters. 

3/28 : I added both the array lists: violatorsList and nonviolatorsList, for loops to print it out however at this time there has being a issue for adding elements into normal arrays [//Read Me: There is a concern of not being able to add in elements to a normal array 3/29, look into it and see if ArrayList better option //If this issue is confirmed to be true it will be a problem to that empty array in the bothLists() method] 

I also added in a new method with parameters as well as creating appropiate conditionals as well. Now when I call the method in the main pulbic static void using people information from the other Javascript code it now works. Take a look and thanks for reading. 

3/29: Reading up on new Java content, will make changes tmw. Thanks.

3/30 - Once I reach ArrayList content I will make edits to those two arrays and possibly a scanner class, other than that minor changes major ones will come in the last few days once I am finished reviewing my java background knowledge.

3/31 -  Testing out the ArrayList code, however there is this issue that it is not recognizing the already defined arrayList. It could be a scope problem as I am trying to access it in a different method, however all methods are auto public. Plan on addressing this tommorow. Side note for the arrayList to work as well I needed to import the pakage, and change a few things like violatorsList.length to violatorsList.size().

04/01 - Bad Fever today, not feeling too good. Will Update tommorow 

04/02 - End date
