# Java-Week2-Practice

3/26 : So for this week I am going to replicate the Javascript Project as well as attempt to use many other java skills like classes as well.

3/27 : Taking time today to review all my Java stuff all day. Side note placed a few lines of codes, more information to come especially the replacent for that function and its parameters. 

3/28 : I added both the array lists: violatorsList and nonviolatorsList, for loops to print it out however at this time there has being a issue for adding elements into normal arrays [//Read Me: There is a concern of not being able to add in elements to a normal array 3/29, look into it and see if ArrayList better option //If this issue is confirmed to be true it will be a problem to that empty array in the bothLists() method] 

I also added in a new method with parameters as well as creating appropiate conditionals as well. Now when I call the method in the main pulbic static void using people information from the other Javascript code it now works. Take a look and thanks for reading. 

3/29: Reading up on new Java content, will make changes tmw. Thanks.

3/30 - Once I reach ArrayList content I will make edits to those two arrays and possibly a scanner class, other than that minor changes major ones will come in the last few days once I am finished reviewing my java background knowledge.

3/31 -  Testing out the ArrayList code, however there is this issue that it is not recognizing the already defined arrayList. It could be a scope problem as I am trying to access it in a different method, however all methods are auto public. Plan on addressing this tommorow. Side note for the arrayList to work as well I needed to import the pakage, and change a few things like violatorsList.length to violatorsList.size().

04/01 - Bad Fever today, not feeling too good. Will Update tommorow 

04/02 - End date (**Changed**)

04/05 - I was able to create the ArrayList, I commented out the old System.out method call single person technique and focused on just printing what has been added into the arraylist in this file called TestRandom.java. Take a look, there is some issue whereby its not printing out a combined list together instead seperately like a loop. I will look into it making final revisions tommorow. I was sick for the past three days had to rest for quite a bit. 

04/06 - Aight so was able to in a way put it next together, and it seems like I had no other choice, other method was that for loop + System.print.ln(i) style which was doing it like a list but it would assign the accurate string like "tested Negative on test for Criminals" for the subjects. So what I did today was just add in the elements and just use this style 
 
 Single Method print outs:
 System.out.println(violatorsList);
 System.out.println(nonviolatorsList);
 
 
 Not much of a difference but I guess whichever is preffered. Nice Jorney though that has come to an end. 
 
Will upload screenshots of the console in case you can't run my codes for some reason.


JvaProgress Screenshot Result (Screenshot) -  Is just a classic conditional simple print for each person

TestRandom Screenshot Result (Screenshot) - Is the add in arraylist of the people and single method print

TestRandomPartTwo Screenshot Result (Screenshot) - Is the for loop style print out of the people added into the arraylist
