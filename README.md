# Java-Week2-Practice

3/26 : So for this week I am going to replicate the Javascript Project as well as attempt to use many other java skills like classes as well.

3/27 : Taking time today to review all my Java stuff all day. Side note placed a few lines of codes, more information to come especially the replacent for that function and its parameters. 

3/28 : I added both the array lists: violatorsList and nonviolatorsList, for loops to print it out however at this time there has being a issue for adding elements into normal arrays [//Read Me: There is a concern of not being able to add in elements to a normal array 3/29, look into it and see if ArrayList better option //If this issue is confirmed to be true it will be a problem to that empty array in the bothLists() method] 

I also added in a new method with parameters as well as creating appropiate conditionals as well. Now when I call the method in the main pulbic static void using people information from the other Javascript code it now works. Take a look and thanks for reading. 

3/29: Reading up on new Java content, will make changes tmw. Thanks.
